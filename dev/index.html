<p>Output from <cite>swiftly</cite>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Usage: swiftly [options] &lt;command&gt; [command_options] [args]

Options:
  -A URL, --auth-url=URL
                        URL to auth system, example:
                        http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/v1.0 You can also set this
                        with the environment variable SWIFTLY_AUTH_URL.
  -U USER, --auth-user=USER
                        User name for auth system, example: test:tester You
                        can also set this with the environment variable
                        SWIFTLY_AUTH_USER.
  -K KEY, --auth-key=KEY
                        Key for auth system, example: testing You can also set
                        this with the environment variable SWIFTLY_AUTH_KEY.
  -D PATH, --direct=PATH
                        Uses direct connect method to access Swift. Requires
                        access to rings and backend servers. The PATH is the
                        account path, example: /v1/AUTH_test You can also set
                        this with the environment variable SWIFTLY_DIRECT.
  -P URL, --proxy=URL   Uses the given proxy URL. You can also set this with
                        the environment variable SWIFTLY_PROXY.
  -S, --snet            Prepends the storage URL host name with "snet-".
                        Mostly only useful with Rackspace Cloud Files and
                        Rackspace ServiceNet. You can also set this with the
                        environment variable SWIFTLY_SNET (set to "true" or
                        "false").
  -R INTEGER, --retries=INTEGER
                        Indicates how many times to retry the request on a

                        the environment variable SWIFTLY_RETRIES.
  -C, --cache-auth      If set true, the storage URL and auth token are cached
                        in /tmp/&lt;user&gt;.swiftly for reuse. If there are already
                        cached values, they are used without authenticating
                        first. You can also set this with the environment
                        variable SWIFTLY_CACHE_AUTH (set to "true" or
                        "false").
  --concurrency=INTEGER
                        Sets the the number of actions that can be done
                        simultaneously when possible. Default: 10
  -v, --verbose         Causes output to standard error indicating actions
                        being taken.
Commands:
  auth                  Outputs auth information.
  delete [options] [path]
                        Issues a DELETE request of the [path] given.
  get [options] [path]  Outputs the resulting contents from a GET request of
                        the [path] given. If no [path] is given, a GET request
                        on the account is performed.
  head [options] [path] Outputs the resulting headers from a HEAD request of
                        the [path] given. If no [path] is given, a HEAD request
                        on the account is performed.

<p>Output from <cite>swiftly help delete</cite>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Usage: swiftly [main_options] delete [options] [path]

For help on [main_options] run swiftly with no args.

Issues a DELETE request of the [path] given.

Options:
  -h HEADER:VALUE, --header=HEADER:VALUE
                        Add a header to the request. This can be used multiple
                        times for multiple headers. Examples: -hx-some-header
                        :some-value -h "X-Some-Other-Header: Some other value"
  --recursive           Normally a delete for a non-empty container will error
                        with a 409 Conflict; --recursive will first delete all
                        objects in a container and then delete the container
                        itself. For an account delete, all containers and
                        objects will be deleted (requires the --yes-i-mean-
                        empty-the-account option).
  --yes-i-mean-empty-the-account
                        Required when issuing a delete directly on an account
                        with the --recursive option. This will delete all
                        containers and objects in the account without deleting
                        the account itself, leaving an empty account. THERE IS
                        NO GOING BACK!
  --yes-i-mean-delete-the-account
                        Required when issuing a delete directly on an account.
                        Some Swift clusters do not support this. Those that do
                        will mark the account as deleted and immediately begin
                        removing the objects from the cluster in the
                        backgound. THERE IS NO GOING BACK!
  --ignore-404          Ignores 404 Not Found responses; the exit code will be
                        0 instead of 1.</pre>

<p>Output from <cite>swiftly help get</cite>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Usage: swiftly [main_options] get [options] [path]

For help on [main_options] run swiftly with no args.

Outputs the resulting contents from a GET request of the [path] given. If no
[path] is given, a GET request on the account is performed.

Options:
  --headers             Output headers as well as the contents.
  -h HEADER:VALUE, --header=HEADER:VALUE
                        Add a header to the request. This can be used multiple
                        times for multiple headers. Examples: -hif-
                        match:6f432df40167a4af05ca593acc6b3e4c -h "If-
                        Modified-Since: Wed, 23 Nov 2011 20:03:38 GMT"
  -l LIMIT, --limit=LIMIT
                        For account and container GETs, this limits the number
                        of items returned. Without this option, all items are
                        returned, even if it requires several backend requests
                        to the gather the information.
  -d DELIMITER, --delimiter=DELIMITER
                        For account and container GETs, this sets the
                        delimiter for the listing retrieved. For example, a
                        container with the objects "abc/one", "abc/two", "xyz"
                        and a delimiter of "/" would return "abc/" and "xyz".
                        Using the same delimiter, but with a prefix of "abc/",
                        would return "abc/one" and "abc/two".
  -p PREFIX, --prefix=PREFIX
                        For account and container GETs, this sets the prefix
                        for the listing retrieved; the items returned will all
                        match the PREFIX given.
  -m MARKER, --marker=MARKER
                        For account and container GETs, this sets the marker
                        for the listing retrieved; the items returned will
                        begin with the item just after the MARKER given (note:
                        the marker does not have to actually exist).
  -e MARKER, --end-marker=MARKER
                        For account and container GETs, this sets the end-
                        marker for the listing retrieved; the items returned
                        will stop with the item just before the MARKER given
                        (note: the marker does not have to actually exist).
  -f, --full            For account and container GETs, this will output
                        additional information about each item. For an account
                        GET, the items output will be bytes-used, object-
                        count, and container-name. For a container GET, the
                        items output will be bytes-used, last-modified-time,
                        etag, content-type, and object-name.
  -r, --raw             For account and container GETs, this will return the
                        raw JSON from the request. This will only do one
                        request, even if subsequent requests would be needed
                        to return all items. Use a subsequent call with
                        --marker set to the last item name returned to get the
                        next batch of items, if desired.
  --all-objects         For an account GET, performs a container GET --all-
                        objects for every container returned by the original
                        account GET. For a container GET, performs a GET for
                        every object returned by that original container GET.
                        Any headers set with --header options are also sent
                        for every object GET.
  -o PATH, --output=PATH
                        Indicates where to send the output; default is
                        standard output. If the PATH ends with a slash "/" and
                        --all-objects is used, each object will be placed in a
                        similarly named file inside the PATH given.
  --ignore-404          Ignores 404 Not Found responses. Nothing will be

For help on [main_options] run swiftly with no args.

Outputs the resulting headers from a HEAD request of the [path] given. If no
[path] is given, a HEAD request on the account is performed.

Options:
  -h HEADER:VALUE, --header=HEADER:VALUE
                        Add a header to the request. This can be used multiple

Options:
  -h HEADER:VALUE, --header=HEADER:VALUE
                        Add a header to the request. This can be used multiple
                        times for multiple headers. Examples: -hx-object-meta-

<p>Output from <cite>swiftly help put</cite>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Usage: swiftly [main_options] put [options] &lt;path&gt;

For help on [main_options] run swiftly with no args.

Performs a PUT request on the &lt;path&gt; given. If the &lt;path&gt; is an object, the
contents for the object are read from standard input.

Special Note About Segmented Objects:

For object uploads exceeding the -s [size] (default: 5G) the object
will be uploaded in segments. At this time, auto-segmenting only
works for objects uploaded from source files -- objects sourced from
standard input cannot exceed the maximum object size for the cluster.

A segmented object is one that has its contents in several other
objects. On download, these other objects are concatenated into a
single object stream.

Segmented objects can be useful to greatly exceed the maximum single
object size, speed up uploading large objects with concurrent segment
uploading, and provide the option to replace, insert, and delete
segments within a whole object without having to alter or reupload
any of the other segments.

The main object of a segmented object is called the "manifest
object". This object just has an X-Object-Manifest header that points
to another path where the segments for the object contents are
stored. For Swiftly, this header value is auto-generated as the same
name as the manifest object, but with "_segments" added to the
container name. This keeps the segments out of the main container
listing, which is often useful.

Options:
  -h HEADER:VALUE, --header=HEADER:VALUE
                        Add a header to the request. This can be used multiple
                        times for multiple headers. Examples: -hx-object-meta-
                        color:blue -h "Content-Type: text/html"
  -i PATH, --input=PATH
                        Indicates where to read the contents from; default is
                        standard input. If the PATH is a directory, all files
                        in the directory will be uploaded as similarly named
                        objects and empty directories will create
                        text/directory marker objects.
  -n, --newer           For PUTs with an --input option, first performs a HEAD
                        on the object and compares the X-Object-Meta-Mtime
                        header with the modified time of the PATH obtained
                        from the --input option and then PUTs the object only
                        if the local time is newer. When the --input PATH is a
                        directory, this offers an easy way to upload only the
                        newer files since the last upload (at the expense of
                        HEAD requests). NOTE THAT THIS WILL NOT UPLOAD CHANGED
                        FILES THAT DO NOT HAVE A NEWER LOCAL MODIFIED TIME!
                        NEWER does not mean DIFFERENT.
  -d, --different       For PUTs with an --input option, first performs a HEAD
                        on the object and compares the X-Object-Meta-Mtime
                        header with the modified time of the PATH obtained
                        from the --input option and then PUTs the object only
                        if the local time is different. It will also check the
                        local and remote sizes and PUT if they differ.
                        ETag/MD5sum checking are not done (an option may be
                        provided in the future) since this is usually much
                        more disk intensive. When the --input PATH is a
                        directory, this offers an easy way to upload only the
                        differing files since the last upload (at the expense
                        of HEAD requests). NOTE THAT THIS CAN UPLOAD OLDER
                        FILES OVER NEWER ONES! DIFFERENT does not mean NEWER.
  -e, --empty           Indicates a zero-byte object should be PUT.
  -s BYTES, --segment-size=BYTES
                        Indicates the maximum size of an object before
                        uploading it as a segmented object. See full help text
                        for more information.</pre>
